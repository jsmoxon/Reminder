pages
1. a place to enter a reminder
2. a place to view your upcoming events/reminders

UI
1. home: login
2. main options: enter reminder, see your current reminders/tasks
3. add: add a reminder
4. list: see your current reminders
4b. functionality of list: 
    - cross them off
    - edit them
    - see their descriptions and details
    - order them as you like; but have them be chronological 

functionality
1. store reminders in a db (done)
2. run a cron job to check to see if any reminders come due
3. if they come due send the email to the appropriate person

how to do this:
a reminder is set
a date is set for the reminder to be sent
the cron job is constantly searching the db for reminiders that have come due
when it finds it needs to send the email




further down the road
1. user accounts/registration
2. calendar type interface
3. ability to check things off the list in ajax
4. have a quick reply command that lets you say: push back and for how long (after 3 times have it say THIS IS THE THIRD TIME...COME ON!)
